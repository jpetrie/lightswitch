INTRODUCTION                                                       *lightswitch*

Lightswitch is a plugin that automatically adjusts the value of `background` to
match the macOS appearance theme. It has no effect on non-macOS systems.

Lightswitch polls once at startup, and then regularly in the background at a
controllable interval. During a poll, if Lightswitch detects that the OS
appearance theme is different from the value of `background`, it will set
`background` accordingly.

|lightswitch.setup({opts})|                                *lightswitch.setup()*
    Lightswitch's setup function, which must be run by the user (if not using
    a plugin manager that does so).

    Usage:
    >
    require("lightswitch").setup({
      -- options go here
    })
<

    Lightswitch supports the following options:

                                                  *lightswitch.options.interval*
    interval: ~
        Determines the time, in milliseconds, between Lightswitch's polling
        attempts. The default value is 1000. A value of 0 or negative values
        will cause Lightswitch to disable the periodic background poll, 
        limiting it to just the initial startup check.

                                                  *lightswitch.options.callback*
    callback: ~
        An optional function that Lightswitch will call after it changes the value
        of `background`. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string
        holding the new `background` value. The default value is nil.
